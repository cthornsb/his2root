README for his2root and hisReader executables.

1) Getting the source
	git clone https://github.com/cthornsb/his2root.git
	This command will make a new directory named "his2root" in the current directory.

2) Installation
	NOTE: Root 5 or higher must be installed in order to install his2root.
	By default, the executables are installed to "./his2root/".
	To install his2root, cd to the directory containing the his2root git repository
	and simply type "make". The Makefile will handle the compilation of the source code.
	
	To install the binaries, type "make install". This will create symbolic links to the
	executables in your home bin directory (~/bin/ by default). To change the install
	location, change the variable named "INSTALL_DIR" in the Makefile.
	
3) Using his2root
	SYNTAX: ./his2root [prefix] <options>
	 Available options:
	  --verbose | Print .drr histogram information.

	his2root may be used to convert every histogram in a .his file into root TH1 or TH2.
	The original input .his file is left unchanged by this program.

	prefix is the .his filename without the extension e.g. if you have a directory with
	the following files
		/home/you/hisfiles/test.his
		/home/you/hisfiles/test.drr
		/home/you/hisfiles/test.list
		/home/you/hisfiles/test.log
	You would call "./his2root /home/you/hisfiles/test". The program will automatically
	load the .his file and .drr file. Note that if either the .his file or the .drr file
	do not exist, the program will terminate.
	
	Passing the "--verbose" flag will print detailed information about each histogram
	which is present in the .drr file.
	
	NOTE: The .his file is basically a large chunk of memory. The .drr file contains all
	 of the information which makes the .his file useful. If the .his file contains less
	 data than the .drr file says it should contain, the program may crash.
	 
4) Using hisReader
	SYNTAX: ./hisReader [prefix]
	
	hisReader may be used to print detailed information about each histogram in the
	.drr file but does not actually convert anything and does not make an output file.
	
	hisReader takes no optional arguments. Follow the instructions listed above for his2root.
	
5) Cleaning up
	Typing "make clean" in the ./his2root/ directory will clean all compiled c++ object files
	which were used to link the executables but will leave the executables untouched. It is
	safe to do "make clean" after compiling the executables.
	
	Typing "make tidy" will remove the executables in addition to the c++ object files. It will
	also remove the symbolic links which were installed to the install directory (if available).
	This command will effectively uninstall his2root and hisReader from the system.
